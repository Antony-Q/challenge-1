## Challenge-01-HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

Site Link: <a href="https://antony-q.github.io/challenge-1" >

This project is a refactor of a webpage for a client, Horiseon, a amarketing agency. The client's main requests were that they wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards, using HTML semantics, and they wanted the site to meet accessibility standards.

This is a list of the requests from the client:

- Find semantic HTML elements within the source code.
- The structure of the HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
- The icon and image elements have accessible alt attributes.
- Make the heading attributes fall in sequential order.
- Create a concise, descriptive title within the title element.

## Changelog Notes (unordered):

- No significant issues were encountered.
- I eliminated the most of the div sections by labeling sections with more specific titles.
- This required class title changes to the CSS.
- Several classes and elements were consolidated where possible.
- CSS was reordered in logical order, in step with the HTML.
- All Client requests were fulfilled.
- Comments added for clarification

This project had no additional collaborators, so if there are any questions regarding the revisions that were made, please direct them to me at antonyq1992@github.com.
